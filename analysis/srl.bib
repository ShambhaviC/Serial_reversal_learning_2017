	abstract = {Bumblebees are capable of rapidly learning discriminations, but ﬂexibility in bumblebee learning is less well understood. We tested bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) on a serial reversal learning task. A serial reversal task requires learning of an initial discrimination between two differentially rewarded stimuli, followed by multiple reversals of the reward contingency between stimuli. A reduction in errors with repeated reversals in a serial reversal task is an indicator of behavioural ﬂexibility. Bees were housed in a large indoor environment and tested during foraging ﬂights. Testing free-ﬂying bees allowed for large numbers of trials and reversals. All bees were trained to perform a simultaneous discrimination between two colours for a nectar reward, followed by nine reversals of this discrimination. Results showed that bumblebees reduced errors and improved their performance across successive reversals. A reduction in perseverative errors was the major cause of the improvement in performance. Bees showed a slight increase in error rate in their ﬁnal trials, perhaps as a consequence of increasing proactive interference, but proactive interference may also have contributed to the overall improvement in performance across reversals. Bumblebees are thus capable of behavioural ﬂexibility comparable to that of other animals and may use proactive interference as a mechanism of behavioural ﬂexibility in varying environments.},

	abstract = {In serial reversal learning, subjects learn to respond differentially to 2 stimuli. When the task is fully acquired, reward contingencies are reversed, requiring the subject to relearn the altered associations. This alternation of acquisition and reversal can be repeated many times, and the ability of a species to adapt to this regimen has been considered as an indication of behavioral flexibility. Serial reversal learning of 2-choice discriminations was contrasted in 3 related species of North American corvids: pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), which are highly social; Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), which are relatively solitary but specialized for spatial memory; and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica), which are ecological generalists. Pinyon jays displayed significantly lower error rates than did nutcrackers or scrub jays after reversal of reward contingencies for both spatial and color stimuli. The effect was most apparent in the 1st session following each reversal and did not reflect species differences in the rate of initial discrimination learning. All 3 species improved their performance over successive reversals and showed significant transfer between color and spatial tasks, suggesting a generalized learning strategy. The results are consistent with an evolutionary association between behavioral flexibility and social complexity.},

Cognitive flexibility is often assessed in complex tasks measuring perceptual attentional shifting or response or task switching, but, arguably, reversal learning is a simple assay of cognitive flexibility. Reversal learning requires the detection of a changed outcome, the cessation of a previously-rewarded response and the selection of an alternative, previously-unrewarded, response.

	abstract = {In the present study we investigated lateralization of color reversal learning in pigeons. After monocular acquisition of a simple color discrimination with either the left or right eye, birds were tested in a serial reversal procedure. While there was only a slight and non-significant difference in choice accuracy during original color discrimination, a stable superiority of birds using the right eye emerged in serial reversals. Both groups showed a characteristic ‘learning-to-learn’ effect, but right-eyed subjects improved faster and reached a lower asymptotic error rate. Subsequent testing for interocular transfer demonstrated a difference between pre- and post-shift choice accuracy in pigeons switching from right to left eye but not vice versa. This can be accounted for by differences in maximum performance using either the left or right eye along with an equally efficient but incomplete interocular transfer in both directions. Detailed analysis of the birds’ response patterns during serial reversals revealed a preference for the right of two response keys in both groups. This bias was most pronounced at the beginning of a session. It decreased within sessions, but became more pronounced in late reversals, thus indicating a successful strategy for mastering the serial reversal task. Interocular transfer of response patterns revealed an unexpected asymmetry. Birds switching from right to left eye continued to prefer the right side, whereas pigeons shifting from left to right eye were now biased towards the left side. The results suggest that lateralized performance during reversal learning in pigeons rests on a complex interplay of learning about individual stimuli, stimulus dimensions, and lateralized response strategies.},

	title = {Sensorimotor learning in bumblebees: long-term retention and reversal training},
	abstract = {Summary Bumblebees were trained in biologically realistic sensorimotor tasks to test how learnt information from more than a single task is organised in memory. Bees (Bombus impatiens and Bombus occidentalis) learned to collect sucrose solution from the arms of small T-mazes. The reward was offered in the right arm of a maze when the entrance was marked blue, and in the left arm when the entrance was yellow. Bees were trained on either one or both of these tasks until after they had reached saturation in terms of speed and accuracy. One group of bees (Bombus impatiens) was evaluated for long-term retention by retesting (a) on the day after training and (b) between 3 and 4 weeks after training. Performance did not decline overnight but, when bees were tested after a delay of several weeks, an increase in error scores and times taken to negotiate mazes occurred. However, bees started out at a better level than during the initial training, indicating that information acquired during initial training had not been entirely erased from memory. A second group of bees (Bombus occidentalis) was tested to see whether it was possible to reverse the association between colour and direction, so that blue entrances now meant that the reward was on the left side, and yellow entrances meant that it was on the right. Bees reached saturation on both tasks as rapidly as they had during the initial training. However, after a second reversal, bees chose directions randomly for several hundred trials, indicating that the ﬁrst-learnt colour–direction associations had not been forgotten as a consequence of the ﬁrst reversal: instead, information from the initial training must have been retained, but actively suppressed, causing difficulties in reestablishing the appropriate sensorimotor associations during the second reversal. Finally, a single Bombus impatiens worker was trained on only a single task, but with multiple reversals. The bee went through an intermediate phase when performance was poor until, after more than seven reversals, it required only three trials to assess that a reversal had taken place. This indicates that bees can learn actively to suppress irrelevant information, but only with an extended training schedule. Taken together, these results suggest that sensorimotor information is rarely lost from long-term memory, either during extended lay-offs or during interfering reversal training sessions. Organizing, correctly retrieving and suppressing information accumulated in memory seems to be more of a challenge than storing new information.},

	abstract = {Several characteristics of flowers and fruits have been suggested as comprising syndromes of characters that indicate particular classes of pollinators and fruit dispersers. Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant-animal interactions be anticipated.},

	abstract = {Orientation depends on multi-modal information about the locally perceptible environment (local view) in many situations. We developed a behavioural paradigm for investigating visual orientation of flying bats based on a large-scale touch screen (1.2m × 1.8m). It functions by a grid of rows and columns of infra-red beams just in front of a screen with back-projected visual stimuli. Approaching animals interrupt the beams and thus permit automatic recording of the time and place of an animal’s locational choice. We used it as a vertical touch surface. Installed as a horizontal walk surface, it may also serve as a more natural ‘firm ground’, circular arena analogue to the ‘Morris water maze’ for investigating orientation behaviour and spatial cognition from rodents to birds while offering automatic real-time recording of paths, times and latencies with enhanced possibilities to score details of motor behaviour and to control stimuli interactively. Bats offer a unique possibility to investigate the use of both echo-acoustic and visual information processing pathways for the process of self-localization and orientation. In our first experiment, a bat was presented with five identical targets, one central and four peripheral and had to choose the central target. After task acquisition, the array was shifted by the distance between targets, so that a formerly peripheral landmark was now in the absolute location of the formerly central target. At small inter-target distances, the bat ‘went with’ the array, and chose the new central target (at a new absolute location). With 30cm or more of inter-target distance (60cm across the landmark configuration), however, the bat went with absolute location, and chose a peripheral target. In experiment 2, the bat was presented with two landmarks 30cm apart and an unmarked target located at midline beneath them. On tests, the landmarks either maintained training distance or were expanded to 50cm apart. On such expansion tests, the bat chose most the location at the correct vector from the right landmark. This showed that the bat first identified a single landmark by the configuration and then applied a previously learnt vector (angle and distance) to locate the target. Glossophaga did not orient by pure angular geometry between landmarks and target.},

Here we used the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension reflex to study how honeybees Apis mellifera perform in a multiple reversal task. Our experiment contemplated four consecutive differential conditioning phases involving the same odors (A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+ to A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+). We show that bees in which the weight of reinforced or non-reinforced stimuli was similar mastered the multiple olfactory reversals. Bees which failed the task exhibited asymmetric responses to reinforced and non-reinforced stimuli, thus being unable to rapidly reverse stimulus contingencies. Efficient reversers did not improve their successive discriminations but rather tended to generalize their choice to both odors at the end of conditioning. As a consequence, both discrimination and reversal efficiency decreasedalong experimental phases. This result invalidates a learning-to-learn effect and indicates that bees do not only respond to the actual stimulus contingencies but rather combine these with an average of past experiences with the same stimuli. \&nbsp;},

Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.},

For this, we examined the ability of bats to discriminate between two nectar volumes in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. We used a Bayesian inference approach to determine psychometric functions. From the derived psychometric function we assessed the discrimination threshold at a value of 0.69. G. soricina could clearly distinguish between two volumes, when the difference between the two nectar volumes divided by their average exceeded this value. This indicates that bats possess a sense for the perception and discrimination of volumes of nectar that is better developed than in honeybees.},

This behavior is sex-specific, as females perform this task without male's assistance. Host nests must be removed from the female’s memory "library" after being parasitized, to avoid repeated parasitism, or when they become unavailable because of predation. Thus, females must adjust their stored information about host nest status more dynamically than males, possibly leading to differences in learning flexibility. We tested for sex differences in a visual (local cues) and a spatial discrimination reversal learning task, expecting females to outperform males as an expression of greater behavioral flexibility. Both sexes learned faster the spatial than the visual task during both acquisition and reversal. In the visual task there were no sex differences in acquisition, but females reversed faster than males. In the spatial task there were no sex differences during either acquisition or reversal, possibly because of a ceiling effect: both sexes learned too fast for differences in performance to be detectable. Faster female reversal in a visual but not spatial task indicates that the greater behavioral flexibility in females may only be detectable above some level of task difficulty.},

Twenty compounds belonging to four different chemical substance classes were tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, the bats (Glossophaga soricina) approached odour sources spontaneously and without preceding experience. Without ever receiving any reward they preferred the scent of a sulphur-containing compound, dimethyl disulphide, to several other odour components emitted by bat-pollinated flowers, and to scentless controls. In the field, at La Selva station in the tropical lowland rain forest of Costa Rica, G. commissarisi were attracted by two sulphur-containing compounds, dimethyl disulphide and 2,4-dithiapentane, to visit artificial flowers filled with sugar water. Thus, in nectarivorous bats the sense of smell obviously plays an important role in searching for and localising food sources, and even single components of the scent bouquets of bat-pollinated flowers are attractive. The preference for sulphur-containing odours seems to be innate.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.

The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.

The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

One possible explanation for such deviations from optimality is that the ability to sense differences in physical value between available alternatives is constrained by the sensory and cognitive processes for encoding proﬁtability. In this study, we investigated the capacity of a nectarivorous bat species (Glossophaga commissarisi) to discriminate between sugar solutions with different concentrations. We conducted a two-alternative free-choice experiment on a population of wild electronically tagged bats foraging at an array of computer-automated artiﬁcial ﬂowers that recorded individual choices. We used a Bayesian approach to ﬁt individual psychometric functions, relating the strength of preferring the higher concentration option to the intensity of the presented stimulus. Psychometric analysis revealed that discrimination ability increases non-linearly with respect to intensity. We combined this result with a previous psychometric analysis of volume perception. Our theoretical analysis of choice for rewards that vary in two quality dimensions revealed regions of parameter combinations where uneconomic choice is expected. Discrimination ability may be constrained by non-linear perceptual and cognitive encoding processes that result in uneconomical choice.},

	abstract = {Cognition is one of the mechanisms underlying behavioural flexibility, but flexibility of cognition itself may vary as a result of trade-offs between the ability to learn new information and the ability to retain old memories. How and when cognitive flexibility is constrained by this trade-off remains poorly understood. We investigated cognitive flexibility in wild food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, at different elevations experiencing different levels of environmental harshness during the nonbreeding season, using a spatial learning and memory reversal paradigm. There were no significant differences in sampling strategies between elevations, but high-elevation chickadees performed worse than low-elevation chickadees on the reversal task, indicating lower cognitive flexibility. Compared to the initial learning task, low-elevation chickadees improved their performance during the reversal task, while high-elevation chickadees performed worse. High-elevation birds inspected previously rewarding locations more frequently than other locations, suggesting that reduced cognitive flexibility is associated with proactive interference. Considering that high-elevation chickadees cache more food and are likely more dependent on these caches than their conspecifics from low elevation, and that chickadees from both elevations use similar sampling strategies, our findings suggest that stronger memories of more caches might interfere with acquisition and retention of new memories. Overall, our results suggest that predictably harsh environments might favour stronger memories at the expense of decreased cognitive flexibility, which is likely driven by increased proactive interference.},

	abstract = {Neotropical rainforests support guilds of nectar feeding bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) with up to six coexisting species. To analyse guild structure and mechanisms of coexistence in a Costa Rican tropical lowland rainforest, the resource use and morphology of bats were compared to the energetic characteristics of preferred nectar resources and their spatio-temporal distribution. The relative abundance of nectar-feeding bats was determined from mistnet captures over 26 months. Food items were identified by analysis of pollen loads and faecal samples. Phenology, flower density and nectar sugar content of resource plants permitted quantitative estimations of resource availability expressed as energy density (kJ ha−1 day−1) throughout the annual cycle. Four glossophagine bat species co-occurred at La Selva: two permanent residents (Glossophaga commissarisi, Hylonycteris underwoodi) and two seasonal species (Lichonycteris obscura, Lonchophylla robusta) that were found in small numbers during a period of high nectar availability. The two resident species differed in their abundance and in their temporal feeding strategies. After the main flowering peak, the common G. commissarisi shifted to a more frugivorous diet, while the rarer H. underwoodi fed on the few remaining bat-flowers. Resource plant species differed in their energy density by up to two orders of magnitude. Hylonycteris underwoodi visited more often plant species with a low energy yield than G. commissarisi. Because of its smaller body size and a wing morphology that promotes fast flight, H. underwoodi appears to be better adapted to low and scattered nectar resource levels. The two seasonal species differed greatly in body mass, which suggests different strategies for high-quality resource tracking. Large body mass in Lonchophylla robusta provides an energy buffer that permits daily commuting flights between a permanent roost and profitable foraging areas, while the small Lichonycteris obscura seems to track resources nomadically. It is proposed that energy density may be a major niche dimension that restricts access of species to certain habitats and that may profoundly influence the structure of nectar-feeding bat guilds.},

	abstract = {Multiple-unit activity of the cingulate cortex and the anteroventral (AV) nucleus of the thalamus in rabbits was recorded during reversal training, following differential conditioning of a locomotory (wheel rotation) avoidance response. The CS+ and CS− were pure tones (1 or 8 kHz) and the UCS was a footshock delivered through the grid floor of the wheel. One group of the rabbits received original training to a criterion followed immediately by reversal training. A second group received training to criterion followed by additional training sessions (overtraining), prior to reversal training. The results indicated that the overtraining reversal effect (ORE) occurred. That is, the overtrained subjects acquired the reverse discrimination in significantly fewer sessions than the non-overtrained subjects. The overall (non-discriminative) neuronal reactivity in all cingulate cortical laminae was reduced by overtraining, whereas the overall reactivity of the AV thalamus was enhanced. In addition, the non-overtrained subjects manifested a discriminative neuronal response appropriate to the original task (i.e. a greater response to the CS− than to the CS+ for reversal training), throughout the precriterial sessions of reversal training. This persistent ‘original habit effect’ occurred only at brief latencies (20–30 msec) after CS onset, and only in the deep cortical laminae (V–VI). The neuronal activity of the superficial laminae (I–IV) in non-overtrained subjects underwent a transition, in parallel with the behavior, from a discriminative response appropriate to the original task to one appropriate to the reversal task. No significant training-related changes were seen at any cortical depth in the overtrained subjects. Presentation of non-contingent footshocks during two sessions of reversal training following criterion re-enhanced the overall reactivity and the brief-latency discriminative neuronal response appropriate to the original task, which had undergone decline during reversal training, in the deep cortical laminae of the non-overtrained subjects. The enhanced overall reactivity and the discriminative activity in the superficial laminae of non-overtrained subjects had not declined during reversal training and were not altered by the non-contingent footshocks. The implications of these data are discussed in regard to the neural causation of the ORE.},

I the effects of overtraining, number of variable irrelevant dimensions, and type of two-choice simultaneous discrimination task on the reversal learning of second-grade children were investigated. Overtraining facilitated reversal learning for color and form (nonspatial) discriminations and had only a slight effect on spatial discriminations. Increasing the number of irrelevant dimensions enhanced, although not significantly, the overtraining reversal effect (ORE) found with nonspatial problems. In Exp. 2 kindergarten children were tested on a spatial discrimination with either zero or two irrelevant dimensions and then administered a reversal shift with half of the Ss receiving overtraining on Problem 1. Two irrelevant dimensions retarded original learning and overtraining retarded reversal learning. The data were interpreted as being consistent with mediational models of discrimination learning provided certain assumptions concerning the perceptual dominance of positional cues were made.},

One hundred seventy-two years after Darwin’s wedding, we reconsider whether this process of choice, under which individuals assign values to their options and compare their relative merits at the time of choosing (the tug-of-war model), applies to our experimental animal, the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. We contrast this with the sequential choice model that postulates that decision-makers make no comparison between options at the time of choice. According to the latter, behaviour in simultaneous choices reflects adaptations to contexts with sequential encounters, in which the choice is whether to take an opportunity or let it pass. We postulate that, in sequential encounters, the decision-maker assigns (by learning) a subjective value to each option, reflecting its payoff relative to background opportunities. This value is expressed as latency and/or probability to accept each opportunity as opposed to keep searching. In simultaneous encounters, choice occurs through each option being processed independently, by a race between the mechanisms that generate option-specific latencies. We describe these alternative models and review data supporting the predictions of the sequential choice model.},

	abstract = {Summary Discrimination and generalization are important elements of cognition in the daily lives of animals. Nectarfeeding bats detect ﬂowers by olfaction and probably vision, but also use echolocation and echo-perception of ﬂowers in immediate target surroundings. The echo received from an interference-rich ﬂower corolla is a function of a bat’s own relative position in space. This raises the question how easily a free-ﬂying bat will generalize an echo stimulus from a learning situation to a new spatial context where differences in relative ﬂight approach trajectories may lead to an unfamiliar spectral composition of the self-generated echoes. We trained freeﬂying Glossophaga soricina in echoacoustic discrimination in a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) paradigm at location A. We then tested at location B for spontaneous transfer of discrimination ability. Bats did not spontaneously transfer the discrimination ability acquired at A to location B. This lack of spontaneous generalization may have been caused by factors of the underlying learning mechanisms. 2-AFC tasks may not be representative of the natural foraging behaviour of ﬂowervisiting bats. In contrast to insect-eating bats that constantly evaluate the environment to detect unpredictable prey, the spatial stability of ﬂowers may allow ﬂower visitors to rely on spatial memory to guide foraging. The 2-AFC task requires the disregard (learned irrelevance) of salient spatial location cues that are different at each new location. In Glossophaga, a conjunction between spatial context and 2-AFC discrimination learning may have inhibited the transfer of learned irrelevance of spatial location in the 2-AFC task to new spatial locations. Alternatively, the bats may have learnt the second discrimination task completely anew, and were faster only because of an acquired learning set. We suggest a dissociation between 2-AFC task acquisition and novel object discrimination learning to resolve the issue.},

	abstract = {Weber’s law quantifies the perception of difference between stimuli. For instance, it can explain why we are less likely to detect the removal of three nuts from a bowl if the bowl is full than if it is nearly empty. This is an example of the magnitude effect – the phenomenon that the subjective perception of a linear difference between a pair of stimuli progressively diminishes when the average magnitude of the stimuli increases. Although discrimination performances of both human and animal subjects in various sensory modalities exhibit the magnitude effect, results sometimes systematically deviate from the quantitative predictions based on Weber’s law. An attempt to reformulate the law to better fit data from acoustic discrimination tasks has been dubbed the “near-miss to Weber’s law”. Here, we tested the gustatory discrimination performance of nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina), in order to investigate whether the original version of Weber’s law accurately predicts choice behavior in a two-alternative forced choice task. As expected, bats either preferred the sweeter of the two options or showed no preference. In 4 out of 6 bats the near-miss to Weber’s law provided a better fit and Weber’s law underestimated the magnitude effect. In order to test the generality of this observation in nectar-feeders, we reviewed previously published data on bats, hummingbirds, honeybees, and bumblebees. In all groups of animals the near-miss to Weber’s law provided better fits than Weber’s law. Furthermore, whereas the magnitude effect was stronger than predicted by Weber’s law in vertebrates, it was weaker than predicted in insects. Thus nectar-feeding vertebrates and insects seem to differ in how their choice behavior changes as sugar concentration is increased. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the observed patterns of sugar concentration discrimination.},

	abstract = {The food—searching behavior of titmice (Paridae) was investigated in laboratory and field to determine how effective individual birds were at locating patchy sources of hidden food. A series of three experiments was performed using tame great tits, Parus major. In Experiment 1, individual birds were offered a choice among six densities of hidden food in discrete patches. The birds learned to concentrate their search strongly on the more dense patches, and five of the six birds preferred to search at the highest density. In Experiment 2, the food distribution was altered by interchanging patches of the highest and lowest density gradually. The birds initially found fewer prey per trial, but soon recovered to near their original performance by switching their search effort to the area containing the second highest prey density. Most birds failed to respond to prey appearing where they had previously been absent. Experiment 3 varied the size of prey items among four areas containing equal numbers of hidden prey. A group of six birds learned to search selectively in areas containing larger prey and, as a result, a greater total quantity of prey. In all experiments, there were marked differences in performance by individual birds. The experiments support Royama's (1970, 1971) hypothesis that great tits distribute their search effort in relation to spatial differences in the profitability of feeding sites. Field observations on a pair of great tits and a pair of blue tits, Parus caeruleus, showed that searching behavior of wild tits was also very selective in space, at least when the birds were feeding nestlings. Birds often returned to previous capture sites and were more likely to do so when they found prey there quickly. These observations suggest that the laboratory experiments have real relevance to the food searching of wild tits. The searching capacity of great tits is discussed; it is suggested that they can approach ideal responses in stable but patchy feeding environments. Some factors leading to deviations from ideal responses are discussed.},

In the procedure we used, rats had to retrieve the location of one baited arm among the eight arms of the maze after it had just been presented as a sample during a forced trial. After attainment of a fixed learning criterion, rats were submitted to five successive shifts in the goal location. Results showed that DS rats were able to learn the position of the goal arm during the acquisition phase as efficiently as sham-operated rats. In contrast, when the position of the goal arm was shifted, although DS rats were able to learn its new position, they made significantly more errors and required more sessions to reach criterion than sham-operated rats. These results suggested that both groups did not solve the task using the same behavioral strategy. The analysis of responses made suggested that sham-operated rats solved the task using the pairing rule between the forced and the free run (matching-to-sample rule), while DS rats solved the task using only visuo-spatial processing. These data therefore suggest that the dorsal striatum plays an important role in rule-learning ability.},

OFC lesions in humans, monkeys, and rats disrupt performance on a common test of this ability, the visual serial discrimination reversal task. This finding is of particular significance to our understanding of psychiatric disorders such as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, in which behavioral inflexibility is a prominent symptom. Although OFC dysfunction can occur in these disorders, there is considerable evidence for more widespread dysfunction within frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar circuitry. Because the contribution of these subcortical structures to behavioral flexibility is poorly understood, the present study compared the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the medial striatum (MS), amygdala, and OFC in the marmoset monkey on performance of the serial reversal task.
            All monkeys were able to learn a novel stimulus–reward association but, compared with both control and amygdala-lesioned monkeys, those with MS or OFC lesions showed a perseverative impairment in their ability to reverse this association. However, whereas both MS and OFC groups showed insensitivity to negative feedback, only OFC-lesioned monkeys showed insensitivity to positive feedback. These findings suggest that, for different reasons, both the MS and OFC support behavioral flexibility after changes in reward contingencies, and are consistent with the hypothesis that striatal and OFC dysfunction can contribute to pathological perseveration.},

We tested cowbirds for sex and seasonal differences in spatial memory on a foraging task with an ecologically relevant retention interval. Birds were trained to find one rewarded location among 25 after 24 h. Females made significantly fewer errors than males and took more direct paths to the rewarded location than males. Females and males showed similar search times, indicating there was no sex difference in motivation.
