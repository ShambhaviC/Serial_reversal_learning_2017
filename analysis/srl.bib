When the task is fully acquired, reward contingencies are reversed, requiring the subject to relearn the altered associations. This alternation of acquisition and reversal can be repeated many times, and the ability of a species to adapt to this regimen has been considered as an indication of behavioral flexibility. Serial reversal learning of 2-choice discriminations was contrasted in 3 related species of North American corvids: pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), which are highly social; Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), which are relatively solitary but specialized for spatial memory; and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica), which are ecological generalists. Pinyon jays displayed significantly lower error rates than did nutcrackers or scrub jays after reversal of reward contingencies for both spatial and color stimuli. The effect was most apparent in the 1st session following each reversal and did not reflect species differences in the rate of initial discrimination learning. All 3 species improved their performance over successive reversals and showed significant transfer between color and spatial tasks, suggesting a generalized learning strategy. The results are consistent with an evolutionary association between behavioral flexibility and social complexity.},

	abstract = {Potential trade-offs between learning speed and memory-related performance could be important factors in the evolution of learning. Here, we test whether rapid learning interferes with the acquisition of new information using a reversal learning paradigm. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were trained to associate yellow with a floral reward. Subsequently the association between colour and reward was reversed, meaning bees then had to learn to visit blue flowers. We demonstrate that individuals that were fast to learn yellow as a predictor of reward were also quick to reverse this association. Furthermore, overnight memory retention tests suggest that faster learning individuals are also better at retaining previously learned information. There is also an effect of relatedness: colonies whose workers were fast to learn the association between yellow and reward also reversed this association rapidly. These results are inconsistent with a trade-off between learning speed and the reversal of a previously made association. On the contrary, they suggest that differences in learning performance and cognitive (behavioural) flexibility could reflect more general differences in colony learning ability. Hence, this study provides additional evidence to support the idea that rapid learning and behavioural flexibility have adaptive value.},

	abstract = {Reversal learning assays are commonly used across a wide range of taxa to investigate associative learning and behavioural flexibility. In serial reversal learning, the reward contingency in a binary discrimination is reversed multiple times. Performance during serial reversal learning varies greatly at the interspecific level, as some animals adopt a rule-based strategy that enables them to switch quickly between reward contingencies. A larger relative brain size, generating enhanced learning ability and increased behavioural flexibility, has been proposed to be an important factor underlying this variation. Here, we experimentally tested this hypothesis at the intraspecific level. We used guppies (Poecilia reticulata) artificially selected for small and large relative brain size, with matching differences in neuron number, in a serial reversal learning assay. We tested 96 individuals over 10 serial reversals and found that learning performance and memory were predicted by brain size, whereas differences in efficient learning strategies were not. We conclude that variation in brain size and neuron number is important for variation in learning performance and memory, but these differences are not great enough to cause the larger differences in efficient learning strategies observed at higher taxonomic levels.},

Neuroimaging studies have focused on prediction errors, reversal errors and reversal switching in the reversal learning paradigm. Due to the inconsistencies of brain functioning across studies, we attempt to shed light on the concordant activity by performing meta-analyses on diﬀerent components of reversal learning. While all contrasts yielded anterior cingulate and bilateral insulae, speciﬁcally prediction errors yielded more concordant activity within the striatum and amygdala, reversal errors yielded more concordant bilateral frontalparietal activity, and more concordant inferior frontal cortical occurred from reversal switching. These ﬁndings suggest that reversal learning is supported by a core saliency network in all aspects of reversal learning as well as other reward and control related regions in distinct stages of this cognitively complex task. Our meta-analyses results provide stereotaxic maps that can be used for further neuroimaging work on adaptive learning.},

We tested bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) on a serial reversal learning task. A serial reversal task requires learning of an initial discrimination between two differentially rewarded stimuli, followed by multiple reversals of the reward contingency between stimuli. A reduction in errors with repeated reversals in a serial reversal task is an indicator of behavioural ﬂexibility. Bees were housed in a large indoor environment and tested during foraging ﬂights. Testing free-ﬂying bees allowed for large numbers of trials and reversals. All bees were trained to perform a simultaneous discrimination between two colours for a nectar reward, followed by nine reversals of this discrimination. Results showed that bumblebees reduced errors and improved their performance across successive reversals. A reduction in perseverative errors was the major cause of the improvement in performance. Bees showed a slight increase in error rate in their ﬁnal trials, perhaps as a consequence of increasing proactive interference, but proactive interference may also have contributed to the overall improvement in performance across reversals. Bumblebees are thus capable of behavioural ﬂexibility comparable to that of other animals and may use proactive interference as a mechanism of behavioural ﬂexibility in varying environments.},

When the task is fully acquired, reward contingencies are reversed, requiring the subject to relearn the altered associations. This alternation of acquisition and reversal can be repeated many times, and the ability of a species to adapt to this regimen has been considered as an indication of behavioral flexibility. Serial reversal learning of 2-choice discriminations was contrasted in 3 related species of North American corvids: pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), which are highly social; Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), which are relatively solitary but specialized for spatial memory; and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica), which are ecological generalists. Pinyon jays displayed significantly lower error rates than did nutcrackers or scrub jays after reversal of reward contingencies for both spatial and color stimuli. The effect was most apparent in the 1st session following each reversal and did not reflect species differences in the rate of initial discrimination learning. All 3 species improved their performance over successive reversals and showed significant transfer between color and spatial tasks, suggesting a generalized learning strategy. The results are consistent with an evolutionary association between behavioral flexibility and social complexity.},

	abstract = {Potential trade-offs between learning speed and memory-related performance could be important factors in the evolution of learning. Here, we test whether rapid learning interferes with the acquisition of new information using a reversal learning paradigm. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were trained to associate yellow with a floral reward. Subsequently the association between colour and reward was reversed, meaning bees then had to learn to visit blue flowers. We demonstrate that individuals that were fast to learn yellow as a predictor of reward were also quick to reverse this association. Furthermore, overnight memory retention tests suggest that faster learning individuals are also better at retaining previously learned information. There is also an effect of relatedness: colonies whose workers were fast to learn the association between yellow and reward also reversed this association rapidly. These results are inconsistent with a trade-off between learning speed and the reversal of a previously made association. On the contrary, they suggest that differences in learning performance and cognitive (behavioural) flexibility could reflect more general differences in colony learning ability. Hence, this study provides additional evidence to support the idea that rapid learning and behavioural flexibility have adaptive value.},

Neuroimaging studies have focused on prediction errors, reversal errors and reversal switching in the reversal learning paradigm. Due to the inconsistencies of brain functioning across studies, we attempt to shed light on the concordant activity by performing meta-analyses on diﬀerent components of reversal learning. While all contrasts yielded anterior cingulate and bilateral insulae, speciﬁcally prediction errors yielded more concordant activity within the striatum and amygdala, reversal errors yielded more concordant bilateral frontalparietal activity, and more concordant inferior frontal cortical occurred from reversal switching. These ﬁndings suggest that reversal learning is supported by a core saliency network in all aspects of reversal learning as well as other reward and control related regions in distinct stages of this cognitively complex task.

For example, time-based control has been found in rats only when tested in a T-maze apparatus and under speciﬁc conditions in which position and orientation (i.e., egocentric) cues during the intertrial interval could not be used to aid performance. Other research in an operant setting has shown that rats often produce minimal errors around the reversal location, demonstrating response patterns similar to patterns exhibited by humans and primates in this task. The current study aimed to reduce, but not eliminate, the ability for rats to utilize egocentric cues by placing the response levers on the opposite wall of the chamber in relation to the pellet dispenser. Results showed that rats made minimal errors prior to the reversal, suggesting time-based cues were not controlling responses, and that they switched to the second correct stimulus within a few trials after the reversal event. Video recordings also revealed highly structured patterns of behavior by the majority of rats, which often diﬀered depending on which response was reinforced. We interpret these ﬁndings as evidence that rats are adept at utilizing their own egocentric cues and that these cues, along with memory for the recent response-reinforcement contingencies, aid in maximizing reinforcement over the session.},

	abstract = {In the midsession reversal task, choice of one stimulus (S1) is correct for the first half of each session and choice of the other stimulus (S2) is correct for the last half of each session. Although humans and rats develop very close to what has been called a win-stay/lose-shift response strategy, pigeons do not. Pigeons start choosing S2 before the reversal, making anticipatory errors, and they keep choosing S1 after the reversal, making perseverative errors. Research suggests that the pigeons are timing the reversal from the start of the session. However, making the reversal unpredictable does not discourage the pigeons from timing. Curiously, pigeons’ accuracy improves if one decreases the value of the S2 stimulus relative to the S1 stimulus. Another form of asymmetry between S1 and S2 can be found by varying, over trials, the number of S1 or S2 stimuli. Counterintuitively, if the number of S2 stimuli varies, it results in a large increase in anticipatory errors but little increase in perseverative errors. However, if the number of S1 stimuli varies over trials, it results in a large increase in perseverative errors but no increase in anticipatory errors. These last two effects suggest that in the original midsession reversal task, the pigeons are learning to reject S2 during the first half of each session and learning to reject S1 during the last half of each session. These results suggest that reject learning may also play an important role in the learning of simple simultaneous discriminations.},

	abstract = {In the present study we investigated lateralization of color reversal learning in pigeons. After monocular acquisition of a simple color discrimination with either the left or right eye, birds were tested in a serial reversal procedure. While there was only a slight and non-significant difference in choice accuracy during original color discrimination, a stable superiority of birds using the right eye emerged in serial reversals. Both groups showed a characteristic ‘learning-to-learn’ effect, but right-eyed subjects improved faster and reached a lower asymptotic error rate. Subsequent testing for interocular transfer demonstrated a difference between pre- and post-shift choice accuracy in pigeons switching from right to left eye but not vice versa. This can be accounted for by differences in maximum performance using either the left or right eye along with an equally efficient but incomplete interocular transfer in both directions. Detailed analysis of the birds’ response patterns during serial reversals revealed a preference for the right of two response keys in both groups. This bias was most pronounced at the beginning of a session. It decreased within sessions, but became more pronounced in late reversals, thus indicating a successful strategy for mastering the serial reversal task. Interocular transfer of response patterns revealed an unexpected asymmetry. Birds switching from right to left eye continued to prefer the right side, whereas pigeons shifting from left to right eye were now biased towards the left side. The results suggest that lateralized performance during reversal learning in pigeons rests on a complex interplay of learning about individual stimuli, stimulus dimensions, and lateralized response strategies.},

	abstract = {Potential trade-offs between learning speed and memory-related performance could be important factors in the evolution of learning. Here, we test whether rapid learning interferes with the acquisition of new information using a reversal learning paradigm. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were trained to associate yellow with a floral reward. Subsequently the association between colour and reward was reversed, meaning bees then had to learn to visit blue flowers. We demonstrate that individuals that were fast to learn yellow as a predictor of reward were also quick to reverse this association. Furthermore, overnight memory retention tests suggest that faster learning individuals are also better at retaining previously learned information. There is also an effect of relatedness: colonies whose workers were fast to learn the association between yellow and reward also reversed this association rapidly. These results are inconsistent with a trade-off between learning speed and the reversal of a previously made association. On the contrary, they suggest that differences in learning performance and cognitive (behavioural) flexibility could reflect more general differences in colony learning ability. Hence, this study provides additional evidence to support the idea that rapid learning and behavioural flexibility have adaptive value.},

Traditional behavioristic frameworks that emphasize the concepts of stimulus, response, and reinforcement and an ”emptyorganism“ psychology - are in need of major revisions. Revised frameworks should incorporate the fact that, in contrast to the lifeless databases of the ”hard“ sciences, the database of psychology entails properties novel to life and its attendant phenomena. The contributions of research this century, achieved by field and laboratory researchers from around the world, have been substantial - indeed revolutionary.

	abstract = {Environmental enrichment induces structural and biochemical changes in the brains of mammals that correlate with improved learning and memory. Research in rats suggests that social compared to inanimate stimulation might affect behavior differently, by acting upon dissociable neural substrates. Here we tested this hypothesis at the behavioral level by examining whether social and inanimate stimulation affect spatial memory formation and non-spatial discrimination reversal learning selectively. Spatial memory formation is known to depend on hippocampal–neocortical pathways, whereas reversal learning depends primarily on prefrontal cortico-striatal pathways. Male Lister hooded rats were housed singly or in groups of three in either small barren or large enriched cages, from weaning onwards. After 10 weeks of differential housing, spatial learning and memory were examined in the Morris water maze, followed by a series of tactile and odour discriminations, including discrimination reversal, in a two-choice discrimination task. Regardless of inanimate stimulation, social deprivation affected neither the acquisition of simple or complex discriminations, nor spatial memory formation, but was associated with impaired reversal learning in the two-choice discrimination task. By contrast, inanimate deprivation, regardless of social stimulation, affected neither acquisition nor reversal of two-choice discriminations, but selectively delayed the acquisition of spatial memory in the Morris water maze. This is the ﬁrst demonstration of a double dissociation of early social and inanimate stimulation on two distinct behavioural functions that are mediated by dissociable underlying neural pathways. These ﬁndings strengthen the view that social and inanimate stimulation act, at least in part, upon dissociable neural substrates.},

Under various conditions, pigeons generally both anticipate the reversal and perseverate once it has occurred, whereas rats tend to make very few of either kind of error. In the present research, we investigated the hypothesis that the difference in performance between rats and pigeons is related to the nature of the responses made. We hypothesized that rats could have been better at bridging the intertrial interval by keeping the relevant paw close to the lever while eating, whereas the pigeons had to remove their beak from the response key and insert it into the feeder, thus making it difficult to mediate the response last made. In the present experiment, in successive phases, rats were trained to leverpress or nose-poke on a 40-trial midsession reversal, an 80-trial midsession reversal, and a variable-location reversal. The results showed that the leverpress group acquired the task faster than the nose-poke group, but that both groups reached comparable levels of performance. Thus, the difference in the natures of the responses cannot fully account for the differences in accuracy between rats and pigeons. Additionally, differences in the types of errors made by the two groups suggest that the nature of the response plays different roles in the performance of this task.},

In the simultaneous-discrimination, midsession-reversal task, one stimulus (S1) is correct for the first half of the session, and the other stimulus (S2) is correct for the second half. After training, pigeons show a curious pattern of choices: They begin to respond to S2 well before the reversal point (i.e., they make anticipatory errors), and they continue to respond to S1 well after the reversal (i.e., they make perseverative errors). That is, pigeons appear to be using the passage of time or the number of trials into the session as a cue to reverse, and are less sensitive to the feedback at the point of reversal. To determine whether the nature of the discrimination or a failure of memory for the stimulus chosen on the preceding trial contributed to the pigeons’ less-than-optimal performance, we manipulated the nature of the discrimination (spatial or visual) and the duration of the intertrial interval (5.0 or 1.5 s), in order to determine the conditions under which pigeons would show efficient reversal learning. The major finding was that only when the discrimination was spatial and the intertrial interval was short did the pigeons perform optimally.},

We examined pigeons’ performance on a visual-spatial discrimination with the reversal point randomized within the session and found that they showed remarkably few errors. When these subjects were split into groups with the contingencies for reward unconfounded, the birds in the spatial-contingency group maintained their performance, and those in the visual-contingency group made many more anticipatory and perseverative errors. We also examined the performance of naïve pigeons on a spatial midsession reversal task and found a pattern of results similar to those shown by pigeons that had previously been trained on a visual-spatial reversal procedure. Finally, we studied rats on a T-maze using a spatial-discrimination midsession reversal task and found that the rats showed a large number of anticipatory and perseverative errors. Near-perfect performance on the midsession reversal task appears to be subject to the ability of the animal to orient spatially during the intertrial interval, rather than being due to broad species differences.},

In the current study, we asked whether pigeons would anticipate changes in reinforcement when the reinforcer contingencies for each stimulus were not ﬁxed in time. We compared the responses of pigeons on a simultaneous choice task when the initially correct stimulus was randomized or alternated across sessions. Pigeons showed more errors overall compared with the typical results of a standard midsession reversal procedure, and they did not show the typical anticipatory errors prior to the contingency reversal. Probe tests that manipulated the spacing between trials also suggested that timing of the session exerted little control of pigeons’ behavior. The temporal structure of the experimental session thus appears to be an important determinant for animals’ use of time in midsession reversal procedures.},

In this task, we examine the relevance of time, reinforcement, and other factors as the switching cue in the sequential modulation of control in MSR. New analyses also highlight some of the potential mechanisms underlying this serially organized behavior. MSR provides new evidence and we offer some ideas about how cues interact to compete for the control of behavior within and across sessions.

Importantly, in Phases 1 and 3, red and green were always presented on the same side, whereas in Phase 2 sidekeys were presented on the left and right equally often. In Phases 2 and 3, probe sessions with intertrial intervals (ITIs) longer or shorter than the training intertribal interval (ITI) were interjected among baseline sessions. Results showed that pigeons presented with visual-only cues used interval duration since the beginning ofthe session to predict when the reversal of reward contingency would occur, but pigeons presented with color and spatial dimensions confounded for predicting reward tended to use a more optimal reward-following strategy of choice based on local reinforcement.},

In our previous work, the two component cues were reinforced with different probabilities (short = 20\%, long = 80\%) to equate response rates, and we found that the compound peak time was biased toward the cue with the higher reinforcement probability. Here, we examined the influence that different reinforcement probabilities have on the temporal location and shape of the compound response function. We found that the time of peak responding shifted as a function of the relative reinforcement probability of the component cues, becoming earlier as the relative likelihood of reinforcement associated with the short cue increased. However, as the relative probabilities of the component cues grew dissimilar, the compound peak became non-scalar, suggesting that the temporal control of behavior shifted from a process of integration to one of selection. As our previous work has utilized durations and reinforcement probabilities more discrepant than those used here, these data suggest that the processes underlying the integration/selection decision for time are based on cue value.},

For example, time-based control has been found in rats only when tested in a T-maze apparatus and under speciﬁc conditions in which position and orientation (i.e., egocentric) cues during the intertrial interval could not be used to aid performance. Other research in an operant setting has shown that rats often produce minimal errors around the reversal location, demonstrating response patterns similar to patterns exhibited by humans and primates in this task. The current study aimed to reduce, but not eliminate, the ability for rats to utilize egocentric cues by placing the response levers on the opposite wall of the chamber in relation to the pellet dispenser. Results showed that rats made minimal errors prior to the reversal, suggesting time-based cues were not controlling responses, and that they switched to the second correct stimulus within a few trials after the reversal event. Video recordings also revealed highly structured patterns of behavior by the majority of rats, which often diﬀered depending on which response was reinforced. We interpret these ﬁndings as evidence that rats are adept at utilizing their own egocentric cues and that these cues, along with memory for the recent response-reinforcement contingencies, aid in maximizing reinforcement over the session.},

When orienting visually, bats choose to 'head for the light' which in a cave marks the exit. When forced to orient acoustically, bats select a closed runway and hang up to roost. With each of the six combinations of visual and acoustic cues tested, bats emit echolocation cries in most trials and indicate by their behaviour that they are aware of the acoustic parameters of their surroundings. Nonetheless, they select their escape route visually whenever possible, disregarding seemingly pertinent acoustic information. This persistent attention to the visual cue was even more marked when captive bats were tested in the laboratory. The results distinguish the functions of vision and echolocation and show the complex relationship between these two senses in microchiropteran bats.},

	title = {Sensorimotor learning in bumblebees: long-term retention and reversal training},
	abstract = {Summary Bumblebees were trained in biologically realistic sensorimotor tasks to test how learnt information from more than a single task is organised in memory. Bees (Bombus impatiens and Bombus occidentalis) learned to collect sucrose solution from the arms of small T-mazes. The reward was offered in the right arm of a maze when the entrance was marked blue, and in the left arm when the entrance was yellow. Bees were trained on either one or both of these tasks until after they had reached saturation in terms of speed and accuracy. One group of bees (Bombus impatiens) was evaluated for long-term retention by retesting (a) on the day after training and (b) between 3 and 4 weeks after training. Performance did not decline overnight but, when bees were tested after a delay of several weeks, an increase in error scores and times taken to negotiate mazes occurred. However, bees started out at a better level than during the initial training, indicating that information acquired during initial training had not been entirely erased from memory. A second group of bees (Bombus occidentalis) was tested to see whether it was possible to reverse the association between colour and direction, so that blue entrances now meant that the reward was on the left side, and yellow entrances meant that it was on the right. Bees reached saturation on both tasks as rapidly as they had during the initial training. However, after a second reversal, bees chose directions randomly for several hundred trials, indicating that the ﬁrst-learnt colour–direction associations had not been forgotten as a consequence of the ﬁrst reversal: instead, information from the initial training must have been retained, but actively suppressed, causing difficulties in reestablishing the appropriate sensorimotor associations during the second reversal. Finally, a single Bombus impatiens worker was trained on only a single task, but with multiple reversals. The bee went through an intermediate phase when performance was poor until, after more than seven reversals, it required only three trials to assess that a reversal had taken place. This indicates that bees can learn actively to suppress irrelevant information, but only with an extended training schedule. Taken together, these results suggest that sensorimotor information is rarely lost from long-term memory, either during extended lay-offs or during interfering reversal training sessions. Organizing, correctly retrieving and suppressing information accumulated in memory seems to be more of a challenge than storing new information.},

Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant-animal interactions be anticipated.},

An average DEE of 12.4 kcal/d and water exchange of 13.4 ml/d were found. Our data show a balanced energy budget when animals in the field imbibe nectar with a sugar concentration of 18–21\%, which is roughly medial in the range of nectar concentrations of various bat flowers. The energy turnover of flower visiting bats is high compared with DEEs of other bat species, small mammals and birds; flower visiting bats seem to belong to those species having ‘a fast spin of the life motor’.},

Despite consuming vast quantities of sugar-rich floral nectar, nectar-feeding bats are long-lived, provoking the question of how they regulate blood glucose. We investigated blood glucose levels in nectar-feeding bats (
              Glossophaga soricina
              ) in experiments in which we varied the amount of dietary sugar or flight time. Blood glucose levels increased with the quantity of glucose ingested and exceeded 25 mmol l

              blood in resting bats, which is among the highest values ever recorded in mammals fed sugar quantities similar to their natural diet. During normal feeding, blood glucose values decreased with increasing flight time, but only fell to expected values when bats spent 75 per cent of their time airborne. Either nectar-feeding bats have evolved mechanisms to avoid negative health effects of hyperglycaemia, or high activity is key to balancing blood glucose levels during foraging. We suggest that the coevolutionary specialization of bats towards a nectar diet was supported by the high activity and elevated metabolic rates of these bats. High activity may have conferred benefits to the bats in terms of behavioural interactions and foraging success, and is simultaneously likely to have increased their efficiency as plant pollinators.},

	abstract = {Orientation depends on multi-modal information about the locally perceptible environment (local view) in many situations. We developed a behavioural paradigm for investigating visual orientation of flying bats based on a large-scale touch screen (1.2m × 1.8m). It functions by a grid of rows and columns of infra-red beams just in front of a screen with back-projected visual stimuli. Approaching animals interrupt the beams and thus permit automatic recording of the time and place of an animal’s locational choice. We used it as a vertical touch surface. Installed as a horizontal walk surface, it may also serve as a more natural ‘firm ground’, circular arena analogue to the ‘Morris water maze’ for investigating orientation behaviour and spatial cognition from rodents to birds while offering automatic real-time recording of paths, times and latencies with enhanced possibilities to score details of motor behaviour and to control stimuli interactively. Bats offer a unique possibility to investigate the use of both echo-acoustic and visual information processing pathways for the process of self-localization and orientation. In our first experiment, a bat was presented with five identical targets, one central and four peripheral and had to choose the central target. After task acquisition, the array was shifted by the distance between targets, so that a formerly peripheral landmark was now in the absolute location of the formerly central target. At small inter-target distances, the bat ‘went with’ the array, and chose the new central target (at a new absolute location). With 30cm or more of inter-target distance (60cm across the landmark configuration), however, the bat went with absolute location, and chose a peripheral target. In experiment 2, the bat was presented with two landmarks 30cm apart and an unmarked target located at midline beneath them. On tests, the landmarks either maintained training distance or were expanded to 50cm apart. On such expansion tests, the bat chose most the location at the correct vector from the right landmark. This showed that the bat first identified a single landmark by the configuration and then applied a previously learnt vector (angle and distance) to locate the target. Glossophaga did not orient by pure angular geometry between landmarks and target.},

Owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate measurements without disturbing flight performance, current estimates of flight cost within the group of small birds and bats differ by more than a factor of five for given body masses. To minimize the potential problem that flight behaviour may be affected by the measurements, we developed an indirect method of measuring flight energy expenditure based on time budget analysis in which small nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaginae) could continue their natural rhythm of flying and resting entirely undisturbed. Estimates of metabolic flight power based on 172 24-h time and energy budget measurements were obtained for nine individual bats from six species (mass 7–28 g). Metabolic flight power (PF) of small bats was found to increase with body mass following the relation PF = 50.2 M0.771 (r2 = 0.96, n = 13, PF in W, M in kg). This is about 20–25\% below the majority of current predictions of metabolic flight cost for small birds. Thus, either the flight cost of small birds is significantly lower than has previously been thought or, contrary to current opinion, small bats require less energy to fly than birds.},

The first part of the book covers the life history and behavioral ecology of bats, from migration to sperm competition and natural selection. The next section focuses on functional ecology, including ecomorphology, feeding, and physiology. In the third section, contributors explore macroecological issues such as the evolution of ecological diversity, range size, and infectious diseases (including rabies) in bats. A final chapter discusses conservation challenges facing these fascinating flying mammals.  Bat Ecology is the most comprehensive state-of-the-field collection for scientists and researchers.

Recent evidence suggests that the neural correlates of reversal learning are localised to the orbitofrontal cortex whereas studies on the contribution of the medial prefrontal cortex to this capacity have produced equivocal results. This study examines the behavioural effects of selective lesions centred on orbitofrontal, infralimbic and prelimbic cortex on serial spatial reversal learning in the rat.
Methods
Rats were trained on a novel instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination and reversal learning task, measuring both ‘cognitive flexibility’ and constituent processes including response inhibition. Both levers were presented, only one of which was reinforced. The rat was required to respond on the reinforced lever under a fixed ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement. Following attainment of criterion, a series of reversals was presented.
Results
Bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex did not affect retention of a preoperatively acquired spatial discrimination but did impair reversal learning. This deficit manifested as increased perseverative responding on the previously correct lever. Although impairments were evident during reversal 1, OFC-lesioned animals performed significantly better than controls on reversal 2. There were no significant effects of infralimbic and prelimbic lesions on the retention of a spatial discrimination or reversal learning.
Conclusions
These results indicate that the orbitofrontal cortex is critical for flexible responding in serial spatial reversal learning. The present findings may be relevant to deficits in reversal learning and response inhibition in such neuropsychiatric disorders as obsessive-compulsive disorder.},

	abstract = {When reward reinforcement in a two-choice discrimination task is regularly changed from one stimulus to another immediately after one learning acquisition session, the learning efficiency of a rat increases as if the rat has come to recognize this regularity of reversal. To investigate how the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in such improvement, we examined the performance of mPFC-lesioned rats in a serial reversal task of olfactory discrimination. The performance of other mPFC-lesioned rats in a delayed alternation task was also analyzed using the same apparatus to evaluate the contribution of the mPFC to working memory. The mPFC-lesioned rats demonstrated selective difficulty in the second reversal session in the serial reversal task and also showed performance impairment in the delayed alternation task. These results suggest that the rat mPFC mediating working memory is involved in early progress in learning efficiency during experiences of multiple reversals, which may be relevant to cognitive operations in reversal learning beyond a one-time reversal of stimulus response associations.},

	abstract = {Learning allows individuals to adapt their behaviours flexibly to changing environment. When the same change recurs repeatedly, acquiring relevant tactics may increase learning efficiency under recurring change. We examined this relationship, along with the effects of proactive interference and other interference information, in a serial spatial reversal task with five grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). Squirrels completed an acquisition and 11 reversal phases with a poke box in which two out of four possible reward locations were baited diagonally in a square array. In this situation, an efficient tactic is to locate the diagonally related locations consecutively (integrative search tactic) instead of searching rewards in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction (sequential search tactic). All the squirrels formed a learning set acquiring successive reversals in fewer trials. Although four individuals gradually employed more integrative tactics in locating the rewards both within and between phases, sequential tactics were used in the first trial of each phase. This suggests the integrative tactic did not depend on an association between the rewarded locations but was learned as a spatial pattern and/or by use of extra-apparatus cues to locate individual reward. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models showed that learning efficiency increased with experience and tactic change. Although tactic change partially mediated the effect of learning on learning efficiency, learning retained an independent contribution to improved efficiency. Squirrels that used integrative tactics more made less total errors than squirrels that used less; suggesting learning a task relevant tactic using spatial cues can provide direct benefits in maximising rewards and minimising time costs.},

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility allows animals to readily acquire new information even when learning contingencies may rapidly change, as is the case in highly variable, but predictable, environments. While cognitive flexibility is broadly thought to be beneficial, animals exhibit inter- and intraspecific variation, with higher levels of flexibility associated with reduced memory retention and vice versa. In this review, we discuss when and why such variation may exist and focus specifically on memory and memory flexibility. We argue that retained memories may negatively affect the acquisition of new information, most likely via proactive interference, and available data suggest that there may be a trade-off between memory retention and acquiring new memories. We discuss neurogenesis-mediated forgetting as the mechanism reducing memory interference, as new neurons enhance learning new information but also cause forgetting of older memories. Selection may be expected to favour either end of the continuum between memory retention and memory flexibility depending on life history and environment. More stable environments may favour memory retention over flexibility whereas rapidly changing environments may favour flexibility over retention. Higher memory capacity also seems to be associated with higher memory interference, so higher neurogenesis rates associated with forgetting of unnecessary information may be favoured when higher capacity is beneficial such as in food-caching species. More research is necessary to understand whether inter- and intraspecific differences in the association between memory retention and flexibility are related to some general ecological patterns, whether this association is heritable, and whether developmental conditions and experience have different effects on this association in different species.},

However, in a changing environment, communicated information can become rapidly outdated. This is a particular problem for pheromone trail using ants, as once deposited pheromones cannot be removed. Here, we study the response of ant foragers to an environmental change. Ants were trained to one feeder location, and the feeder was then moved to a different location. We found that ants responded to an environmental change by strongly upregulating pheromone deposition immediately after experiencing the change. This may help maintain the colony's foraging flexibility, and allow multiple food locations to be exploited simultaneously. Our treatment also caused uncertainty in the foragers, by making their memories less reliable. Ants which had made an error but eventually found the food source upregulated pheromone deposition when returning to the nest. Intriguingly, ants on their way towards the food source downregulated pheromone deposition if they were going to make an error. This may suggest that individual ants can measure the reliability of their own memories and respond appropriately.},

	abstract = {Parental care systems are shaped by costs and benefits to each sex of investing into current versus future progeny. Flexible compensatory parental care is mainly known in biparental species, particularly where parental desertion or reduction of care by 1 parent is common. The other parent can then compensate this loss by either switching parental roles and/or by increasing its own parental effort. In uniparental species, desertion of the caregiver usually leads to total brood loss. In the poison frog, Allobates femoralis , obligatory tadpole transport (TT) is generally performed by males, whereas females abandon their clutches after oviposition. Nevertheless, in a natural population we previously observed 7.8\% of TT performed by females, which we could link to the absence of the respective fathers. In the following experiment, under laboratory conditions, all tested A. femoralis females flexibly took over parental duties, but only when their mates were removed. Our findings provide clear evidence for compensatory flexibility in a species with unisexual parental care. Contrary to the view of amphibian parental care as being stereotypical and fixed, these results demonstrate behavioral flexibility as an adaptive response to environmental and social uncertainty. Behavioral flexibility might actually represent a crucial step in the evolutionary transition from uniparental to biparental care in poison frogs. We suspect that across animal species flexible parental roles are much more common than previously thought and suggest the idea of a 3-dimensional continuum regarding flexibility, parental involvement, and timing, when thinking about the evolution of parental care.},

	abstract = {Summary Bumblebees were trained in biologically realistic sensorimotor tasks to test how learnt information from more than a single task is organised in memory. Bees (Bombus impatiens and Bombus occidentalis) learned to collect sucrose solution from the arms of small T-mazes. The reward was offered in the right arm of a maze when the entrance was marked blue, and in the left arm when the entrance was yellow. Bees were trained on either one or both of these tasks until after they had reached saturation in terms of speed and accuracy. One group of bees (Bombus impatiens) was evaluated for long-term retention by retesting (a) on the day after training and (b) between 3 and 4 weeks after training. Performance did not decline overnight but, when bees were tested after a delay of several weeks, an increase in error scores and times taken to negotiate mazes occurred. However, bees started out at a better level than during the initial training, indicating that information acquired during initial training had not been entirely erased from memory. A second group of bees (Bombus occidentalis) was tested to see whether it was possible to reverse the association between colour and direction, so that blue entrances now meant that the reward was on the left side, and yellow entrances meant that it was on the right. Bees reached saturation on both tasks as rapidly as they had during the initial training. However, after a second reversal, bees chose directions randomly for several hundred trials, indicating that the ﬁrst-learnt colour–direction associations had not been forgotten as a consequence of the ﬁrst reversal: instead, information from the initial training must have been retained, but actively suppressed, causing difficulties in reestablishing the appropriate sensorimotor associations during the second reversal. Finally, a single Bombus impatiens worker was trained on only a single task, but with multiple reversals. The bee went through an intermediate phase when performance was poor until, after more than seven reversals, it required only three trials to assess that a reversal had taken place. This indicates that bees can learn actively to suppress irrelevant information, but only with an extended training schedule. Taken together, these results suggest that sensorimotor information is rarely lost from long-term memory, either during extended lay-offs or during interfering reversal training sessions. Organizing, correctly retrieving and suppressing information accumulated in memory seems to be more of a challenge than storing new information.},

	abstract = {In multiple reversal learning, animals trained to discriminate a reinforced from a non-reinforced stimulus are subjected to various, successive reversals of stimulus contingencies (e.g. A+ vs. B-, A- vs. B+, A+ vs. B-). This protocol is useful to determine whether or not animals "learn to learn" and solve successive discriminations faster (or with fewer errors) with increasing reversal experience. Here we used the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension reflex to study how honeybees Apis mellifera perform in a multiple reversal task. Our experiment contemplated four consecutive differential conditioning phases involving the same odors (A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+ to A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+). We show that bees in which the weight of reinforced or non-reinforced stimuli was similar mastered the multiple olfactory reversals. Bees which failed the task exhibited asymmetric responses to reinforced and non-reinforced stimuli, thus being unable to rapidly reverse stimulus contingencies. Efficient reversers did not improve their successive discriminations but rather tended to generalize their choice to both odors at the end of conditioning. As a consequence, both discrimination and reversal efficiency decreasedalong experimental phases. This result invalidates a learning-to-learn effect and indicates that bees do not only respond to the actual stimulus contingencies but rather combine these with an average of past experiences with the same stimuli. \&nbsp;},

	abstract = {Environments characterized by scarce and variable food supply, termed “harsh environments,” have been hypothesized to favor cognitive abilities that aid an animal in finding food, remembering where it is located, or predicting its availability. Most studies of the “harsh environment” hypothesis have found that scatter hoarders from harsher environments have better spatial memory abilities, but few studies have looked at this hypothesis in nonscatter hoarders. Here, we present the first comparison of performance on a serial reversal learning task in a nonscatter hoarder from 2 elevations that differ in harshness. Serial reversal learning tasks measure a suite of cognitive abilities that are believed to allow an animal to adjust its foraging behavior to match changes in the availability of food over time. Therefore, performance on this task is predicted to increase with elevation. There was no significant difference between the high and low elevation great tits in initial reversal learning accuracy. While both high and low elevation birds were able to improve their reversal learning accuracy, they did not differ in their rate of improvement over reversals. However, we found that lower elevation birds had higher accuracy across all reversals. Contrary to the “harsh environment” hypothesis, our findings suggest that birds from the less harsh environment at low elevation performed more accurately on the reversal learning task. Overall, our results suggest that the study of the relationship between harshness and cognition in nonhoarders would benefit from taking into account other environmental factors, and trade-offs with other cognitive abilities.},

	abstract = {The relationship between foraging behavior and resource availability for the long—nosed bat (Glossophaga soricina) and five species of plants it fed on in northern Columbia was investigated in a 10—mo study. Glossophaga employed two foraging tactics: (1) territorial defense of concentrated food sources, and (2) trapline foraging along regularly used feeding routes. The tactic used depended on availability of Agave desmettiana nectar and the individual bat's ability to dominate conspecifics. When both hunger and nectar levels were highest, bats concentrated their feeding activity on A. desmettiana. Aggressive behavior was displayed by dominant male and female bats during the first 3—5 h of feeding. Territorial behavior ceased suddenly when nectar levels were depleted by 50\% or more at 2.5—5 h after sunset. Later in the evening, bats foraged briefly from one plant to another at several species along regularly used routes. Bats that maintained early—evening territories had increased access to nectar—rich agave flowers and had significantly smaller total foraging areas than nonterritorial bats. The feeding territories of female Glossophaga were shared with their immature offspring. Territorial behavior at agave was attributed in part to defensibility of its flowers. Foraging experiments demonstrated that G. soricina used a feeding strategy that was efficient with respect to choice of food patch and allocation of time. This is the first study that used marked individuals to document feeding territories and trapline foraging for nectar—feeding bats.},

	abstract = {W.K. Estes often championed an approach to model development whereby an existing model was augmented by the addition of one or more free parameters, and a comparison between the simple and more complex, augmented model determined whether the additions were justified. Following this same approach we utilized  own augmented learning equations to improve the fit and plausibility of a win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS) model that we have used in much of our recent work. Estes also championed models that assumed a comparison between multiple concurrent cognitive processes. In line with this, we develop a WSLS-Reinforcement Learning (RL) model that assumes that the output of a WSLS process that provides a probability of staying or switching to a different option based on the last two decision outcomes is compared with the output of an RL process that determines a probability of selecting each option based on a comparison of the expected value of each option. Fits to data from three different decision-making experiments suggest that the augmentations to the WSLS and RL models lead to a better account of decision-making behavior. Our results also support the assertion that human participants weigh the output of WSLS and RL processes during decision-making.},

	abstract = {Impairments in reversal learning have been attributed to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) dysfunction in many species. However, the role of subcortical areas interconnected with the OFC such as the striatum remains poorly understood. This study directly evaluated the contribution of core and shell sub-regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum to reversal learning of an instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination task in rats. Selective NAc core, DMS and DLS lesions were achieved with microinjections of quinolinic acid and NAc shell lesions with ibotenic acid. Damage to NAc core or shell did not affect retention of a previously acquired instrumental spatial discrimination. In contrast, DLS and DMS lesions produced changes in aspects of discrimination performance such as the latency to collect earned food pellets. Neither NAc core or shell lesions nor DLS lesions affected the main indices of reversal performance. Conversely, DMS lesion rats showed a significant impairment in reversal learning. DMS damage increased the number of errors to reach criteria that were perseverative in nature. The deficit in reversal learning in DMS lesion rats was not associated with an impairment to extinguish instrumental responding. There were no effects on spontaneous locomotor activity. Our data are in agreement with recent work showing that lesions of the medial striatum in marmoset monkeys produce perseverative impairments during a serial visual discrimination reversal task and support the hypothesis that dorsomedial striatal dysfunction contributes to pathological perseveration, which is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders.},

Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.},

In this study, we determined the psychometric function for nectar volume discrimination of a Neotropical flower-visiting bat Glossophaga soricina. For this, we examined the ability of bats to discriminate between two nectar volumes in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. We used a Bayesian inference approach to determine psychometric functions. From the derived psychometric function we assessed the discrimination threshold at a value of 0.69. G. soricina could clearly distinguish between two volumes, when the difference between the two nectar volumes divided by their average exceeded this value. This indicates that bats possess a sense for the perception and discrimination of volumes of nectar that is better developed than in honeybees.},

What is the current status of Darwin's claim that other species share the same 'mental powers' as humans, but to different degrees? In this completely revised second edition of Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior, Sara Shettleworth addresses these questions, among others, by integrating findings from psychology, behavioral ecology, and ethology in a unique and wide-ranging synthesis of theory and research on animal cognition, in the broadest sense - from species-specific adaptations of vision in fish and associative learning in rats to discussions of theory of mind in chimpanzees, dogs, and ravens. She reviews the latest research on topics such as episodic memory, metacognition, and cooperation and other-regarding behavior in animals, as well as recent theories about what makes human cognition unique"--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Females of brood parasitic shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, search and prospect host nests, synchronizing parasitism with host laying. This behavior is sex-specific, as females perform this task without male's assistance. Host nests must be removed from the female’s memory "library" after being parasitized, to avoid repeated parasitism, or when they become unavailable because of predation. Thus, females must adjust their stored information about host nest status more dynamically than males, possibly leading to differences in learning flexibility. We tested for sex differences in a visual (local cues) and a spatial discrimination reversal learning task, expecting females to outperform males as an expression of greater behavioral flexibility. Both sexes learned faster the spatial than the visual task during both acquisition and reversal. In the visual task there were no sex differences in acquisition, but females reversed faster than males. In the spatial task there were no sex differences during either acquisition or reversal, possibly because of a ceiling effect: both sexes learned too fast for differences in performance to be detectable. Faster female reversal in a visual but not spatial task indicates that the greater behavioral flexibility in females may only be detectable above some level of task difficulty.},

	abstract = {Rodent behavioral tasks are crucial to understanding the nature and underlying biology of cognition and cognitive deficits observed in psychiatric and neurological pathologies. Olfaction, as the primary sensory modality in rodents, is widely used to investigate cognition in rodents. In recent years, automation of olfactory tasks has made it possible to conduct olfactory experiments in a time- and labor-efficient manner while also minimizing experimenter-induced variability. In this study, we bring automation to the next level in two ways: First, by incorporating a radio frequency identification-based sorter that automatically isolates individuals for the experimental session. Thus, we can not only test animals during defined experimental sessions throughout the day but also prevent cagemate interference during task performance. Second, by implementing software that advances individuals to the next test stage as soon as performance criteria are reached. Thus, we can prevent overtraining, a known confounder especially in cognitive flexibility tasks. With this system in hand, we trained mice on a series of four odor pair discrimination tasks as well as their respective reversals. Due to performance-based advancement, mice normally advanced to the next stage in less than a day. Over the series of subsequent odor pair discriminations, the number of errors to criterion decreased significantly, thus indicating the formation of a learning set. As expected, errors to criterion were higher during reversals. Our results confirm that the system allows investigating higher-order cognitive functions such as learning set formation (which is understudied in mice) and reversal learning (which is a measure of cognitive flexibility and impaired in many clinical populations). Therefore, our system will facilitate investigations into the nature of cognition and cognitive deficits in pathological conditions by providing a high-throughput and labor-efficient experimental approach without the risks of overtraining or cagemate interference.},

Twenty compounds belonging to four different chemical substance classes were tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, the bats (Glossophaga soricina) approached odour sources spontaneously and without preceding experience. Without ever receiving any reward they preferred the scent of a sulphur-containing compound, dimethyl disulphide, to several other odour components emitted by bat-pollinated flowers, and to scentless controls. In the field, at La Selva station in the tropical lowland rain forest of Costa Rica, G. commissarisi were attracted by two sulphur-containing compounds, dimethyl disulphide and 2,4-dithiapentane, to visit artificial flowers filled with sugar water. Thus, in nectarivorous bats the sense of smell obviously plays an important role in searching for and localising food sources, and even single components of the scent bouquets of bat-pollinated flowers are attractive. The preference for sulphur-containing odours seems to be innate.},
